## Overview
This project involved analyzing a subset of the **NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)** dataset provided during the challenge. The dataset included demographic details, biometric readings (e.g., BMI, glucose, insulin), and physical activity indicators for individuals.

The task was to **predict the age group** (Adult or Senior) of individuals based on their health parameters, using the provided training and test CSV files. Extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling were performed to extract meaningful patterns from the raw data.

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Predictive modeling (classification/regression)  

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
Built a logistic regression model that achieved **98.92% validation accuracy** in classifying individuals into age groups. The project showcased robust handling of missing values, outlier treatment, and model evaluation using real-world health data.
