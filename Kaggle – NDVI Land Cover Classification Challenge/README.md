## Overview
The objective was to classify land cover types using NDVI time-series data from satellite imagery, with ground-truth labels sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite noisy NDVI signals due to cloud cover and annotation inconsistencies, the challenge was to build a **Logistic Regression** model capable of accurate classification.

## Key challenges:
- **Noise** due to clouds and inaccurate labels  
- **Missing data** from obstructed satellite views  
- **Seasonal variations** in NDVI requiring careful preprocessing

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and imputation (MENTION APPROACH)
- Outlier (MENTION APPROACH)
- (ADDITIONAL FEATURE ENGINEERING METNION APPROACH)
- Feature preparation from NDVI time series
- Multiclass Logistic Regression modeling and evaluation

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
Built a **Logistic Regression** model that achieved **(MENTION)% validation accuracy** in classifying noisy satellite-based land cover data.
The project showcased robust preprocessing and modeling strategies for handling real-world time-series geospatial data.
